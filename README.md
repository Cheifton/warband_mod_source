Temporary fork of LilyC-Dev's Warband mod, Dickplomacy Reloaded

Here's a short do-it-yourself compiling tutorial for randoms that pop in here from LL:

Step 1: Download/install Python 2.7 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/ it should default to "C:\Python27", probably best not to change it.

Step 2: Setup enviroment variables in 5 easy clicks https://i.imgur.com/7iaGdag.jpg

Step 3: Replace the source folder in the module folder with the new one you download from here

Step 4: In the source folder, change "module_info.py" to point to the module folder.

Step 5: In the source folder, double-click compile.bat

Enjoy
