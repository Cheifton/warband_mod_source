Step 2: Setup enviroment variables in 5 easy clicks https://i.imgur.com/7iaGdag.jpg

Step 3: Replace the source folder in the module folder with the new one you download from here

Step 4: In the source folder, change "module_info.py" to point to the module folder.

Step 5: In the source folder, double-click compile.bat
