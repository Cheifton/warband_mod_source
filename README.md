# warband_mod_source
Source for my Warband mod, Dickplomacy Reloaded if you fork it, which you have full permission to do, credit my module as the source module,
and make sure that your mod includes your source code.

NOTE: If you are using a public version this code most likely won't work, you would be missing resources. This is for developers, however, there are some cases in which you can drag and drop this repo in the Dickplomacy Reloaded module folder and compile it without issues.
